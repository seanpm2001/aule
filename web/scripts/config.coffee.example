    # Optional MyGene.info configuration used for frequency lookup by
    # transcript. This should be an object with the following fields:
    #
    # - species:
    #   Query MyGene.info for transcripts in this organism.
    # - exons_field:
    #   Field name in MyGene.info gene annotation containing a dictionary with
    #   coordinate data for each transcript. Coordinates should correspond
    #    with the reference genome of the Varda server.
    # - email:
    #   MyGene.info encourages regular users to provide an email, so that they
    #   can better track the usage or follow up with you. This field is
    #   optional.
