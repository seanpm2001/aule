Varda web client
================

The web admin is a client-side JavaScript-driven interface for the Varda REST
server. The HTML5 layout is based on Twitter Bootstrap and uses Less
stylesheets. The interface is implemented in CoffeeScript using the Sammy
jQuery-based framework and ICanHaz.js for Moustache templates.

At the moment, both the Less stylesheets and the CoffeeScript files are
compiled dynamically in the browser to CSS and JavaScript, respectively. In
the future, we could pre-compile them. Same goes for the Mustache templates,
we could use Hogan.js for compiled templates.


Webserver configuration
-----------------------

By the same-origin-policy, the web admin must be served from the same domain
as the REST server.

Example nginx configuration:

    upstream varda_server {
        server 127.0.0.1:5000;
    }

    server {
        listen 8181;
        server_name celly;
        location / {
            root /home/martijn/projects/varda-web/web;
            try_files $uri /varda.html;
        }
        location /api/v1/ {
            proxy_pass http://varda_server/;
        }

    }
