A web interface to the Varda database for genomic variation frequencies.

**This is a work in progress, not ready for use!**


Description
-----------

Varda is an application for storing genomic variation data obtained from next-
generation sequencing experiments, such as full-genome or exome sequencing of
individuals or populations. Variants can be imported from standard formats
such as [VCF](http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41)
files, or annotated for presence in previously imported datasets.

Varda is implemented by very loosely coupled components, communicating using
a RESTful protocol over HTTP with json-encoded response payloads.

* **Varda** - Server exposing a RESTful API for managing and querying the
    variant database.
* **Manwë** - Python client library and command line interface to Varda.
* **Aulë** - Web interface to Varda.

This is Aulë.

The web interface is a client-side JavaScript-driven interface to the Varda
REST server. The HTML5 layout is based on Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
and uses [Less](http://lesscss.org/) stylesheets. The interface is implemented
in [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) using the [Sammy.js](http://sammyjs.org/)
framework.

At the moment, both the Less stylesheets and the CoffeeScript files are
compiled dynamically in the browser to CSS and JavaScript, respectively. In
the future, we could pre-compile them. Same goes for the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/)
templates, we could for example use [Hogan.js](http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/)
for compiled templates.


Webserver configuration
-----------------------

By the same-origin-policy, the web admin must be served from the same domain
as the REST server.

Example nginx configuration:

    upstream varda {
        server 127.0.0.1:5000;
    }

    server {
        listen 8181;
        server_name celly;
        location / {
            root /home/martijn/projects/aule/web;
            try_files $uri /index.html;
        }
        location /api/v1/ {
            proxy_pass http://varda/;
        }

    }
